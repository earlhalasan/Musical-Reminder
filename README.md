## Premise

Create playlists, see what songs are in them, update them, and remove songs if you'd like!

## User Story

As a user, log-in and create new playlists. Within the playlists, you can add songs where you'll see the artist, album, and song names. Tired of a song? Feel free to delete it. Feel like switching up the mood? Create a new playlist and build it up from scratch!
